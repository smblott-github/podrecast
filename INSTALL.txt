Install the Executables and Sample the Configuration File
---------------------------------------------------------

One of the following:

   Install globally:
      sudo python ./setup.py install

   Install locally:
      python ./setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local


Install podrecast as a CGI Script
---------------------------------

The location of the CGI bin directory and its configuration are system
dependent.  It may be possible to hard link the podrecast executable into
the CGI bin, or link to it with a symbolic link.

Or, install it manually; something like one of these:

   Install globally:
      sudo install -v -m 0555 ./podrecast /usr/lib/cgi-bin/

   Install locally:
      install -v -m 0555 ./podrecast ~/public_html/cgi-bin

Customize and Install the Configuration File
--------------------------------------------

The setup script installs a sample configuration file in
PREFIX/podrecast.conf.sample.  Copy this to a suitable location and
customize it to meet your own needs.

---------

   - podrecast
