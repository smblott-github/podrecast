PodRecast
=========

PodRecast -- a podcast aggregator for post-processing then re-publishing podcasts.

## What is this?

Here's my problem:

- I hate it when one podcast is loud, then the next is too quiet, then the next
  is *way* too loud.

- In the EU, there are rules governing the maximum output which consumer
  devices, such as smart phones, can generate through headphones.  In a noisy
  environment (for me, that's when cycling) the mandated volume can be too
  low, particularly for spoken podcasts.
  
Both of these problems can be addressed by downloading podcasts to a server,
post processing the files there (possibly with `mp3gain`, then republishing
them on a local network.

That's what `PodRecast` does.

See the [web page](http://podrecast.smblott.org/) for more details.
